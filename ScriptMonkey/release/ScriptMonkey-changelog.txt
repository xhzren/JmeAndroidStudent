Release TBD
------------
* Added a standard log binding that scripts can use for logging.
* Added the basic HUD window support.
* Added button click hook support and window-managed buttons.
* Added a selectionHook API
* Added a SelectionIndicator control that can be attached to any
    spatial to highlight its Mesh(es) as wire frame.
* Fixed a bug where default imports weren't being made available
    to initialization scripts.    
* Fixed a problem where the file chooser dialog wasn't being 
    brought to front when invoked from an in-HUD button press.
* Modified the material param stuff to do its own type checking
    because JME waits until render time to resolve these and
    then the app crashes.


Release 1279
-------------
* fixed a bug that would cause node += child to set node to an int.
* Added initial "mode" support as a global app state.
* Added "modeHook" scripting support
* Added ColorRGBA math add-ons like for the Vector classes.
* Added camera lookAt convenience functions.  Takes Spatial, Vector3f, or x,y,z
* Fixed a legacy bug in the console state where binding variables set through 
    callbacks were getting wiped out.
* Added a SelectionState to keep track of the selected spatial and provide click-through
    support.
* Exposed the selected spatial through a "selected" binding and allow easy script-based
    selection changing with setSelected()
* Removed the Node.plus() overload because it works strangely in the case of node += child
    and doesn't look right as just node + child.  Replaced it with leftShift, ie: node << child
* Added Node.leftShift to add a child to a node.
* Added ability to Node to do .each{}, .findAll{}, etc.
* Added Spatial.flatten() to flatten the spatial into a single collection of itself and all
    of its children.
* Added visit(Class) version of the visit method for visiting only nodes of a specific
    type.  ie: rootNode.visit(Geometry) { println it }
